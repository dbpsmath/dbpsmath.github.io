    <title>WEBSITE SHUTDOWN</title>
  </head>

     <h1>This website is officially shut down.</h1>
     <p>And here's why:</p>
     <p>I started this website around 3 years ago, as a way to let out my boredom in school</p>
     <p>This website was a passion, but it's more of a curse now, and the games being hosted on my site makes it harder for the devs to get paid.</p>
     <p>I'm broke. I can't afford licenses to games, and I want devs being paid. I don't want to be sent copyright infrigement notices.</p>
     <p>I know this is disappointing, but don't be sad it's over, be happy that it happened.</p>
     <p>DBP, signing off. Thanks for an amazing 3 years.</p>
