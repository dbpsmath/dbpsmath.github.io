## I'm a sysadmin and want to block this, how do I?
To answer your question, for most sites you can never fully block them. Sure, you can block my links, but anyone can make a link.
Even if you block every hosting platform somebody can still just buy a domain
## How can I help?
If you have good skills in coding, then fork our repository, make your changes, and make a pull request. If it's good then we'll pull it.
## How can I help without coding?
Spread the word! Tell your friends, family, or your dog! It really helps out.
## I want to start my own website. How should I do it?
The only advice I can give you is to not make a google site. Abnumality has a very good [series on how to make one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etmaj7clLCI&list=PLPCCmOayz-5DeKnxCkh4wbHgXLNNdfOgL), but it is for google sites. But you can do it without Google Sites. For learning HTML, CSS, and JS I'd recommend W3Schools.
